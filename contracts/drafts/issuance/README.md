# Issuance

This is an Ethereum project that implements a simple Issuance that can be used for an ICO.

## IssuanceAdvanced

### Description

This issuance contract accepts investments using an accepted ERC20 token, and it will return to the investor a different ERC20 token if certain conditions are met.

The issuance is governed by the following parameters:
`currencyToken`: The token that is accepted in payment for investments.
`issuanceToken`: The token that will be issued if conditions are met.
`openingDate`: The time at which investments start being accepted.
`closingDate`: The time at which investments stop being accepted, and distribution of issued tokens is possible.
`issuePrice`:  The amount of currency tokens that are required to buy one issued token.
`softCap`: The minimum mount of currency that needs to be raised for tokens to be distributed.
`minInvestment`: The minimum amount of currency that can be invested in one go.

               ,-> LIVE
SETUP -> OPEN -
               `-> FAILED

First set the issuance parameters using the `set*` functions.

To open the issuance to investors, the owner must call `openIssuance()`.

The `Issuance` will mint `IssuanceToken`s (which inherit from `ERC20Mintable` and `ERCDetailed`, hence they are ERC20 tokens) to all investors who participated in the ICO (having `invest()`ed more than `minInvestment` and their investment being a multiple of `issuePrice`) during `openingDate` and `closingDate`.

If the `softcap` has been reached, investors are free to `withdraw()` their alloted tokens after the owner of the `Issuance` proceeds to `startDistribution()`.

Otherwise, investors are invited to reclaim their investemnts using `cancelInvestment()` after the owner of the `Issuance` does `cancelAllInvestments()`.

At any time during which the `Issuance` is in `OPEN` state, the investors can change their minds and reclaim their investments with `cancelInvestment()`.

### Usage
---
```
constructor(
    string memory _issuanceName,
    string memory _issuanceSymbol,
    uint8 _issuanceDecimals,
    address _acceptedToken
)
```
Initializes the `Issuance` with the `_issuanceName`, `_issuanceSymbol` and `_issuanceDecimals` for the `IssuanceToken` that will be minted to investors and also takes as a paramater the address of the `_acceptedToken` that will be the ERC20 token that investors will pay in.

---
```
openIssuance()
```
Opens the investing phase, setting the `Issuance` state to `OPEN`.

---

```
invest(uint256 _amount)
```
Request from investor to invest

---

```
cancelInvestment()
```
Request from investor to cancel his investment

---

```
startDistribution()
```
Opens the distributing phase, setting the `Issuance` state to `LIVE`.

---

```
withdraw()
```
Request from investor to withdraw `IssuanceToken`s

---

```
cancelAllInvestments()
```
Starts the cancellation phase, setting the `Issuance` state to `FAILED`.

---

```
setIssuePrice(uint256 _issuePrice)
```
Setter for _issuePrice. Can only be called during `SETUP`.

---

```
setOpeningDate(uint256 _openingDate)
```
Setter for _openingDate. Can only be called during `SETUP`.

---

```
setClosingDate(uint256 _closingDate)
```
Setter for _closingDate. Can only be called during `SETUP`.

---

```
setSoftCap(uint256 _softCap)
```
Setter for _softCap. Can only be called during `SETUP`.

---

```
setMinInvestment(uint256 _minInvestment)
```
Setter for _minInvestment. Can only be called during `SETUP`.

## IssuanceEth

It has the same structure and functionality as the `IssuanceAdvanced` contract, however, investments got through the fallback function (i.e., `currencyToken` is ethereum).
