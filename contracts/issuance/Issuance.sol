/**
 * @title Issuance
 * @dev Implements a very simple issuance process for tokens
 *
 * 1. Initialize contract with issuance token and currency token. Both tokens must inherit from ERC20Minatble and ERC20Detailed.
 * 2. Use `setIssuePrice` to determine how many currency tokens do investors
 *    have to pay for each issued token.
 * 3. Use `startIssuance` to allow investors to invest.
 * 4. Investors can `invest` their currency tokens at will.
 * 5. Investors can also `cancelInvestment` and get their currency tokens back.
 * 6. The contract owner can `cancelAllInvestments` to close the investment phase.
 *    In this case `invest` is not available, but `cancelInvestment` is.
 * 7. Use `startDistribution` to close the investment phase.
 * 8. Investors can only `claim` their issuance tokens now.
 * 9. Owner can use `withdraw` to send collected currency tokens to a wallet.
