/**
 * @title Issuance
 * @notice Implements a very simple issuance process for tokens
 *
 * 1. Initialize contract with the issuance token contract address. This address must inherit from `ERC20Mintable` and `ERC20Detailed`.
 * 2. Use `setIssuePrice` to determine how many ether (in wei) do investors
 *    have to pay for each issued token.
 * 3. Use `startIssuance` to allow investors to invest.
 * 4. Investors can `invest` their ether at will.
 * 5. Investors can also `cancelInvestment` and get their ether back.
 * 6. The contract owner can `cancelAllInvestments` to close the investment phase.
 *    In this case `invest` is not available, but `cancelInvestment` is.
 * 7. Use `startDistribution` to close the investment phase.
 * 8. Investors can only `claim` their issued tokens now.
 * 9. Owner can use `withdraw` to send collected ether to a wallet.
